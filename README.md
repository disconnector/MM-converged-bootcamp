# MM-converged-bootcamp
# 2016 Federation SE CI Enablement Training Schedule

# High level objectives

- Required result - we are trying to get the SE population moving towards a place where they can _successfully and confidently_ **present, size, and sell** converged solutions.
- The training is suggested to last 2-3 days
- We should include cross-Federation and cross-functional groups (VCE, VMware, EMC, DPS, etc) wherever possible.
- Let the SMEs in each area cover their subject (VMware talk about VMware sizing, EMC talks about storage, etc)
- We need to have this done and locked down by about the middle of March (at the latest) so Dan has time to lock down resources, locations, and calendars.
- The entire 3 day session will be led by a team of EMC, VMware, and VCE SEs with SMEs brought in as needed.  In other words – there will be one deck and three presenters that will take turns and interweave their messages.  ONE TEAM – ONE FEDERATION!

# Needed items from Leadership

- A presenter from each manufacturer that is qualified to present the materials herein.  There should be a representative from EMC, VCE, and VMware
- Any other specialists that are needed for the material listed below
- Presentation materials, demos, or whiteboards for each section
- The manufacturers should choose one individual to be the overall spokesman and MC to keep things on track
- A facility large enough to seat everyone comfortably
- A whiteboard and a projector
- Food
  1. Day 1 – light snacks
  2. Day 2  - snacks and lunch (if not in a building with a cafeteria)
  3. Day 3 – snacks and a very light lunch (possibly)
- A mic for the presenters if necessary
- Awards for the following:
  1. Blocks, Racks, Rails whiteboard presentation
  2. Four other awards for teams that have presented their team scenarios – make them light but funny (ribbons or certificates) . . . see last days events for more details.
- Shared (SyncP or fileserver) scenario for the day 3 event
- A functioning clock and the will to use it.  The timing is critical to maintain – we will need to be brutal with time.

# Overall Daily Schedule

| Day | Hours | Lunch? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Noon to 6:00pm | Eat lunch before you arrive |
| 2 | 8am – 6:00pm | Working lunch |
| 3 | 8am – 2pm | Bring a snack (or we provide one) |

# A quick note

It has been pointed out several times that there is a dearth of breaks and a scarcity of lunch time.  This is an unfortunate side effect of needing to get 2 tons of face melting awesomesauce into a bag about the size of a Pez dispenser.  We have cut this schedule down several times and we still feel that we could use more time for discussion – and we&#39;re already slave drivers running from 8am to 6pm.  Please be understanding if someone needs to step out several times through the day for a few minutes to clear their head 

Day 1 – 12 noon to 6pm

In seats and ready to roll by noon.  Anyone late on any day has to stand in front of the room and sing the National Anthem.  Music will be provided.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD1heornT7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD1heornT7Y)
