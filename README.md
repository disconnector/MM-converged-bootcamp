# MM-converged-bootcamp
Midmarket converged bootcamp
2016 Federation SE CI Enablement Training Schedule

High level objectives
•	Required result - we are trying to get the SE population moving towards a place where they can successfully and confidently present, size, and sell converged solutions.
•	The training is suggested to last 2-3 days
•	We should include cross-Federation and cross-functional groups (VCE, VMware, EMC, DPS, etc) wherever possible.
•	Let the SMEs in each area cover their subject (VMware talk about VMware sizing, EMC talks about storage, etc)
•	We need to have this done and locked down by about the middle of March (at the latest) so Dan has time to lock down resources, locations, and calendars.
•	The entire 3 day session will be led by a team of EMC, VMware, and VCE SEs with SMEs brought in as needed.  In other words – there will be one deck and three presenters that will take turns and interweave their messages.  ONE TEAM – ONE FEDERATION!
Needed items from Leadership 
•	A presenter from each manufacturer that is qualified to present the materials herein.  There should be a representative from EMC, VCE, and VMware
•	Any other specialists that are needed for the material listed below
•	Presentation materials, demos, or whiteboards for each section
•	The manufacturers should choose one individual to be the overall spokesman and MC to keep things on track
•	A facility large enough to seat everyone comfortably
•	A whiteboard and a projector
•	Food
1.	Day 1 – light snacks
2.	Day 2  - snacks and lunch (if not in a building with a cafeteria)
3.	Day 3 – snacks and a very light lunch (possibly)
•	A mic for the presenters if necessary
•	Awards for the following:
1.	Blocks, Racks, Rails whiteboard presentation
2.	Four other awards for teams that have presented their team scenarios – make them light but funny (ribbons or certificates) . . . see last days events for more details.
•	Shared (SyncP or fileserver) scenario for the day 3 event
•	A functioning clock and the will to use it.  The timing is critical to maintain – we will need to be brutal with time.

Overall Daily Schedule

Day	Hours	Lunch?
1	Noon to 6:00pm	Eat lunch before you arrive
2	8am – 6:00pm	Working lunch
3	8am – 2pm	Bring a snack (or we provide one)

A quick note
It has been pointed out several times that there is a dearth of breaks and a scarcity of lunch time.  This is an unfortunate side effect of needing to get 2 tons of face melting awesomesauce into a bag about the size of a Pez dispenser.  We have cut this schedule down several times and we still feel that we could use more time for discussion – and we’re already slave drivers running from 8am to 6pm.  Please be understanding if someone needs to step out several times through the day for a few minutes to clear their head 

Day 3 – 8:00am – 2:00pm
Scenario Based engineering and selling
Here’s the fundamental question – do we want more groups each with a shorter time to present or less groups with more time?  There are advantages either way . . . . 
This day is going to the by far the most impactful – we need to make sure that this part is 100% thought through.
8:00 – 8:15 – Exercise set up
•	Divide class into 6 groups and have each elect a spokesperson
•	Hand out and explain the scenario 
o	The scenario will contain the following:
	Business needs and drivers
	Technical needs and limitations
	IT / application team descriptions
	Future growth and expectations
o	Each group will be expected to create the following deliverable:
	A valid configuration that meets the technical/business needs
	A 15-minute presentation to “sell” the configuration back to the class
o	The scenario will be difficult – this will not be simple.
•	We may need to have folks get up and move so that they can collaborate
•	Be sure to emphasize that this is *competitive* and that there is an award for doing the best job.  Our SEs do their best work in a competitive environment!
